HemoNet: Predicting Hemolytic Activity with Integrated Feature Learning
A multiple branch network that performs nuclear instance segmentation and classification within a single network. The network leverages the horizontal and vertical distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass to separate clustered cells. A dedicated up-sampling branch is used to classify the nuclear type for each segmented instance.
